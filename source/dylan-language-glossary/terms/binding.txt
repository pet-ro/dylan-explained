.. _dylan-term-binding:

binding 
-------

  A binding is a simple construct and a core concept of the dylan language. 
  
  A *binding*  is simply an *association* of a 
  :ref:`name <dylan-term-name>` 
  with a value. 

.. _dylan-term-binding(kind):

  A binding can either be 

  - modifyable, which means the same name can be bind 
    to a new value. A modifyable binding is sometimes also called:
    
    - *mutable*,
    - variable or 
    - writable.
  
  or a binding can be of the opposite of modifyable.

  Such a binding is called 
  - *immutable*.  Sometimes also:
   
    - constant or 
    - read-only. 

 
.. _dylan-term-binding(sharing):

  Each binding 

  - is owned by exactly one *serving module*, but 
  - it can be shared with other modules via 
    :ref:`client-server interaction of modules 
    <dylan-term-client-server-interaction-of-modules>`.
  
  
  
  The dylan language creates bindings via 
  :ref:`definitions <dylan-term-definition>`.

  :ref:`Binding sharing <dylan-term-binding-sharing>` is one of two 
  :ref:`name sharing variants <dylan-term-name-sharing-variants>`.
