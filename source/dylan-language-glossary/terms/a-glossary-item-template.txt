.. About this file
  contains one (!) glosssary entry (and a workaround 
  note written as glossary entry.) 
  Onyl multiterms entry should be in one file. In all
  other cases a file contains one glossary entry.
  The content gets fetched by a `include` 
  directive of Sphinx. 
  write 0 whitespaces in front of the label
  write 2 whitespaces infront of description.

Label of a glossary term (intended by 3 whitespaces):
  Use 6 whitespace in front of the glossary term's 
  description. That's it. 

A workaround note for Sphinx
  It's not possible to write a ReST `include` directive directly after
  a `glossary` directive. A possible workaround is to load glossary 
  items via the `include` directive after a glossary item, which
  is n't loaded by `include`directive and follows directly
  after the `glossary`directive.
