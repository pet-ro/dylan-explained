.. _dylan-term-modularization:

modularization
--------------

  The dylan language support modularization well: 
  it provides a :term:`hierarchical modularity`.
  Code gets encapuslated into :term:`modules <module>`. 
  :term:`Modules <module>` are :term:`sealed <sealing>` and can 
  be nested. 
  The top-level modul is named :term:`dylan-user`.
  In this module a software project defines it 
  :term:`library` which represents its 
  hierarchy of :term:`modules <module>`.
 
  For non- :term:`interactive code` a :term:`library`
  is the :term:`compilation unit` and the finest granularity
  unit of :term:`deployment` in the dylan language.
