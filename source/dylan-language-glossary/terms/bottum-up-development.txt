buttom-up development
  A buttom-up development process becomes easier when a well designed grouping 
  mechanism is provided. The dylan language support such grouping mechanism. 
  In buttom-up development you first hack some 
  :term:`definitions <definition>`. 
  You may decide to spread them over several 
  :term:`source records <source record>` (source files).
  As your code grows, name clashes pop up as you try to stay consistent 
  with of your model. At this point you would like to open up a new 
  namespace. The dylan language provides a new :term:`namespace` with each 
  :term:`definition of a module <module>`. Several namespaces can be grouped
  together to a :term:`library`. New modules and libraries in dylan are 
  :term:`sealed`, which means no other module or library can use its names and
  binding. To break this default sealing you have to explicitly export the 
  names and bindings from their source modularity unit and import them to 
  their new destination modularity. These dylan language features support 
  the concept of :term:`hierarchical modularity` well.
