.. _dylan-term-name-only-sharing:

name only sharing
-----------------

  A special :term:`name sharing variant` is :term:`name only sharing`, 
  which allows a module to play the role of an *interface*.

  A :term:`name only sharing` is a 
  :term:`client-server interaction of modules` by *serving module* 
  provides the *client module* a name only.
  *Name only* means that the *serving module* owns a name which is mot
  bind to a value. While in the other :term`name sharing variant` the 
  *serving module* owns a name which is binded to a value. 
  (That variant s called :term:`binding sharing`.)

  The dylan language allows a :samp:`define module` unit of the
  *serving module* to provide *name only* via the :samp:`create` clause.  

  :term:`Name only sharing` is the dylan language construct that essential
  for the :term:`interface role of a module`. 

  A special variant of :term:`name only sharing` is that the 
  *serving module* does *not* create the :term:`name` , but is a *client* to 
  *another serving module*. 
  In case the *serving module* contains a :samp:`use` clause with a
  *export* option, which re-exports the imported name.

  :samp:`use another-module, import: { a-relevant-name }, export: all;`
