.. _dylan-term-name:

name
---- 
  Names are an essential part of :term:`definitions <definition>`. 
  A :term:`definition` creates an association between a name and a value.
  Such an association is called :term:`binding`.

  The dylan language allows to create a name alone, too. 
  A name alone is not associate to value, but must get its
  association to a value by one of the modules of the *same*
  library. A :samp:`create` clause of :samp:`define module`
  unit creates a *name only*, which means this :term:`name`  is not 
  associated to a *value*. *Name only* means: 
  A name without binding.

  In the dylan language  the *sharing of name* occurs between 
  :term:`modules<module>`. To understand the different 
  :term:`roles of modules` is necessary to distinct between
  
  (*) :term:`name sharing`, which shares a name which is bound to value.
  
  (*) :term:`name only sharing`, which shares a name which is not bound
  to a value. 

  The glossary term :term:`roles of modules` depict the usefulness of this
  distinction.
