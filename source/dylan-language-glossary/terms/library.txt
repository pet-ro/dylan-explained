library
-------
  A :term:`library` is a :term:`sealed<sealing>` container of 
  :term:`modules<module>`. Only exported modules of 
  a :term:`library` can be shared with other libraries.  
  A library in the dylan language represents not only aggregated 
  :term:`modules<module>`, 
  but also a  :term:`compilation unit` which gets transfered into executable
  code (exe) or dynamically linkable code (dll). 
  The name of library specifies the name of the :term:`compilation unit`.

  A library groups namesspaces ( :term:`modules<module>` ) together. 
 
  To create a library you create a new :term:`source record` with the 
  specific header :samp:`Module dylan-user`. In this module you write a 
  :samp:`define library` section to specifies the 
  :term:`hierarchical modularity` of your programm.  
  Libraries, together with modules, are the core language elements to build up 
  the :term:`hierarchical modularity`. 

  :samp:`define library` is a built-in :term:`definition` of the dylan language.
