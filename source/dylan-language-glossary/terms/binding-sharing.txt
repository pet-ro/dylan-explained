.. _dylan-term-binding-sharing:

binding sharing
---------------

  A *binding sharing* is one of two
  :ref:`name sharing variants 
  <dylan-term-name-sharing-variants>` 
  which the dylan language provides.  
  In *binding sharing* not only a *name* is shared, but also a
  *value* that is bound to the *name*.
 
  A *binding sharing* is introduced by an :samp:`export` clause 
  in :samp:`define module` of a *binding serving module*.
  This prepares the binding sharing between modules which
  is a kind of 
  :ref:`client-server interaction of modules
  <dylan-term-client-server-interaction-of-modules>`
  .
   
  On the *server side* the related clause in the :samp:`define module` unit
  looks like this: 
   
  - :samp:`export a-binding, another-binding;`

  On the *client side* a possible clause in a :samp:`define module` 
  may look like this 
  
  - :samp:`use a-serving module, import: \{ a-binding, another-binding\};`
  
  which is in this case equal to

  - :samp:`use a-serving-module, import: all`;

  To only provide the *a-binding* one may write, for example:

  - :samp:`use a-serving-module, inport: all, exclude: {another-binding};`

  The *binding sharing*  allows a :ref:`module <dylan-term-module>` 
  to play the role of a *substrate* (see
  :ref:`roles of modules
  <dylan-term-roles-of-modules>`).
