.. _dylan-term-definition:

definition
----------
  Definitions are a dylan language construct to create 
  :ref:`bindings<dylan-term-binding>`. 
 
  The dylan language provides several build-in definitions:
 
  - :samp:`define constant`, 
  - :samp:`define method`.
  - :samp:`define class`,
  - :samp:`define module`, and
  - :samp:`define library`.
  

  The last two definitions (
  :ref:`module
  <dylan-term-module>`
  , 
  :ref:`library
  <dylan-term-library>`
  ) 
  are the dylan language constructs to build up 
  :ref:`hierarchical modularity
  <dylan-term-hierarchical-modularity>`.
  
  A special definition is :samp:`define macro`, which allows to 
  author a *domain specific language (DSL)*.

  All the definitions  listed here so far 
  are *constant* built-in definitions. Other definitions 
  may be *variable* built-in definitions:
  
  - Variable built-in definitions are for example: 
    
    - :samp:`define variable` and
    - :samp:`define generic method`.
  
    The last definition is essential for a mechanism called
    :ref:`method dispatch
    <dylan-term-method-dispatch>`
    , 
    which the dylan language provides. 
 
  Details for each definition are given in the related entries 
  in the `Dylan Reference Manaual (DRM)`.
