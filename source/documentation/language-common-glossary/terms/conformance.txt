.. _language-term-conformance:


conformance
-----------

  Nominal vs. structural conformance:
  
  - Nominal: name of the interface matters
   
    - e.g., inheritance in OO languages

    - conformance is declared and explicit


  - Structural: only the requirements matter

    - e.g., record types, ML signatures
  
    - conformance is implicit


  In the contenxt of :ref:`generic programming
  <language-term-generic-programming> ::
  
    structural conformance + automatic dispatching = danger !!!
