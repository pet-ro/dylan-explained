.. _dylan-term-type:


type
----

  The dylan language supports the type

  - :ref:`class
    <dylan-term-class>`

  and several non-class types:

  - :ref:`singleton
    <dylan-term-singleton>`

  - :ref:`union
    <dylan-term-union>`

  - :ref:`limited types
    <dylan-term-limited-type>`
 

  All *types* are :ref:`first-class objects
  <dylan-term-first-class-object>` and are
  general instances of the class *<type>*.

  Implementations may add additional kinds of types, but the
  language specification does not define any way for the 
  programmer to define new subclasses of *<types>*.
