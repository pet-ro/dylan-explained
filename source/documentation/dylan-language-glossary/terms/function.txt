.. _dylan-term-function:


function
--------

  In the dylan language functions can be used as basic building blocks that
  enable abstraction, as functions themselvses can be arguments to other
  functions:

  - functions are :ref:`first-class objects`
    <dylan-term-first-class-object>` 
    in the dylan language.

  Functions that take functions as argument are called 
  :ref:`higher-order functions
  <dylan-term-higher-order-function>`.

 Whenever we identify a commonly occurring piece of code, 
 
 - we encapsulate it as a function and
 - abstract over differences by turning these into a function argument (???)
