source record
  As its name specifies it does record source code 
  A source record can be either a file or, any other useful storage 
  representation, for example, a database entry.
       
  The dylan language allow that several source records represent 
  a :term:`library`. Related to the dylan reference manual 
  how source code is associated with a library is controlled by 
  the programming environment and is implementation-defined.
     
  The dylan implementation *OpenDylan* allows the following:
  The source records of a library (compilation unit) is grouped into
  a :samp:`define library` section which can not be fragmentated; while 
  its :samp:`define module` sections can be fragementated over 
  several source records. 
     
  Every possible :term:`definition` allowed in a :samp:`define module`
  section is the smallest possible fragment of a module's source record.
