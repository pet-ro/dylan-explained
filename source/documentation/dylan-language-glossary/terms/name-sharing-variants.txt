.. _dylan-term-name-sharing-variants:

name sharing variants
---------------------

  Names are shared between 
  :ref:`modules <dylan-term-module>`. 

  There are two variants: sharing a name and its binded value 
  (:ref:`binding sharing <dylan-term-binding-sharing>`) 
  or 
  :ref:`name only sharing <dylan-term-name-only-sharing>`.
 
  These variants define which role a module plays:
  
  - The  ref:`interface role of a module 
    <dylan-term-interface-role-of-a-module>` 
    requires a :ref:`name only sharing <dylan-term-name-only-sharing>`. 

  - The :term:`substrate role of a module` requires
    a :ref:`binding sharing <dylan-term-binding-sharing>`.

  Names are shared in a :ref:`client-server interaction of modules
  <dylan-term-client-server-interaction-of-modules>`.
