component-oriented programming
   Distributed extensibility is the essence of component-oriented
   programming.  As an organizational paradigma, component-oriented 
   programming is concerned with the composition and interaction of 
   components and frameworks through interfaces, it is not concerned 
   with their insides in any way. The computational paradigm at the core 
   of a component-oriented programming language is therefore not
   constrained, i.e. the core can be imperative, functional or 
   logical. However, `Frohlich(2003)`_  
   claims that it is necessary to use a language 
   which allows static typing. In component-oriented programming
   static typing ensures the safety of a composition.
   The dylan language is compliant with this requirement of 
   component-oriented programming. Its typing
   can be defined to be dynamically or statically.
