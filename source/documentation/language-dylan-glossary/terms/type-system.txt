type system
-----------

  The dylan language is object-oriented and has a nominal type system:

  - class inheritance is declared explicitly

  In a nominal type system a developer explicitly writes down superclasses
  of a given class. This defines the subtype relation of classes. 
  A structural type system is capable to look at the structure of types.
