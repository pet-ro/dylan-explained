method dispatch
---------------

  The process of determining which method to call when a 
  :ref:`generic function
  <dylan-term-generic-funtion>`
  is applied to arguments. 
  Based on the run time (dynamic) type of its arguments
  (one or more) the process dynamically dispatchs to the 
  apropriate method.
