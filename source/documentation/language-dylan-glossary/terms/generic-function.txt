  :samp:`define generic method` introduces in the dylan language
  the :ref:`definiton
  <dylan-term-definition>`
  of a *generic function*.


.. _dylan-term-generic-function(definition:

  A :ref:`function
  <dylan-term-function>`
  that works for many :ref:`types`
  <dylan-term-type>` 
  and on the *structure of data type* 
  is called a *generic function*.


.. _dylan-term-generic-function(method-dispatch):

  *Generic functions* in concert with the types of the used arguments
  determine the behaviour of object in the dylan lanuage:

  - When an *object* is passed as an argument to a *generic function*,
    the *generic function* looks at the type of the object
    to determine which method should be run. 
    
    - This process is called :ref:`multi-dispatch
      <dylan-term-method-dispatch>`
