.. _dylan-term-polymorphism              :

polymorphism
------------

  Polymorphim  is an important idea easily understand if we
  first understand type variables  first.


  This enables to abstract functionality well. Other dylan language
  features that support generic programming well are:
  
  - :ref:`higher-order functions
    <dylan-term-higher-order-functions>`

  - a type sytem which allows :ref:`polymorphism
    dylan-term-polymorphism>`.




   Used references:

   - [Book: The Functional Approach to Programming (1998)]_
     introduced  the idea to explain type variables first.


  The most important features that support these activities are
 
  - a types system equipped with parametric polymorphism








  

  The dylan language supports parametric polymorphism by writing
  *generic functions* for types classes.

  Classic examples of such generic functionality are

  - getter generic function of a slot
  - setter generic function of a slot
