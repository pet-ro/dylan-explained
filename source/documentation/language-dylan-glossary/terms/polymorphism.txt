polymorphism
------------

  Polymorphim  is an important idea easily understand if we
  first understand type variables  first.

  -  A type discipline is said to be *polymorphic*
     if it allows the use variable types.
  
  -  A function is daid to be polymorphic if its type
     is polymorphic.






  The most important features that support these activities are
 
  - a types system equipped with parametric polymorphism


  The dylan language supports parametric polymorphism by writing
  *generic functions* for types classes.

  Classic examples of such generic functionality are

  - getter generic function of a slot
  - setter generic function of a slot
