retargetable compiler
---------------------
 
[Book: Crafting a Compiler with C] defines:
   

  A retargetable comipler is one whose target machine can be changed without
  rewriting its machine-independent components. A retargetable compiler 
  is more difficult to write than an ordinary because target machine 
  dependencies must be carefully localized.
